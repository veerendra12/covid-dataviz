                    As promised in the beginning, I am hopful that you (along with me) are able to conlude on following things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Although the virus made it's entry in the late January'20, it has not really impacted greatly until late March</li>
                        <li>New york and New Jersey showed to be one of the very few states worst effected during April-May. 
                            However these two states were able to well contain the virus in the coming months</li>
                        <li>Data viz. showed that after Memorial day, lot of states steadily showed virus spread. 
                            This clearly indicates that lack of social distancing and not wearing masks badly impacted the states</li>
                        <li>Viz. clearly shows that Texas, California and Florida are the top most epicenter at the moment (i.e. June 22nd)</li>
                    </ul>
