                    COVID-19 a.k.a Coronovirus disease needs no introduction for anyone living (of course children are to be exempted :)) on the mother earth during the year 2019-2020. 
                    Everyone of us from every nook and corner of the world has been fighting with it.
                    COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                    Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
                    For more details about the virus, you may refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">this wiki</a>.

                    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                    Although this novel virus is claimed to be originated in early December 2019, it made its entry into the USA during late January 2021 and still fighting the battle with it.
